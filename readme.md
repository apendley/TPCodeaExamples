TPCodeaExample
=

Example project for TexturePacker exporters (TPCodea) and tpBatch.lua


Instructions:
=

1. Import SmallWorldSprites.png into Codea through your photo album (make sure to name it SmallWorldSprites, and make sure "Retina" is on when you import it)
2. Install the TPExample project into the Codea app
3. Open the TPExample Project and run it!

Notes:
=

* This project uses the Codea (project tab) exporter.
* I've added the Small World assets and the TexturePacker file for reference, so you can see the settings used to create the sprite sheet. Pay special attention to the AutoSD options if you plan on making your sprite sheet retina-ready.
